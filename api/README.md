**As per any authenticated user web application, a user must sign-in to create their own contacts to see all necessary functionality.**

Our group project is called <b>Campfire</b>. The purpose of this web application is for a user to log into the webapp, and be able to add "contacts" into their personalized address book, and be able to set frequencies for how often they would like to reconnect with their contacts. Thus by using this webapp, the user will always be reconnecting with contacts in accordance to how often they want to reconnect with them. Forgetfulness is no longer a factor when using Campfire. The basis of this project has been created using the boilerplate code used from the MERN Stack Issue Tracker Book Project by Vasan Subramanian.
